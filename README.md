# HTML-and-CSS-Projects

This is the remote repository for storing my coding projects from my Web Development course.

The purpose of this repository is to create basic portfolio: 
1. Practice forking projects to my GitHub accounts. 
2. Cloning the project to my local machine. 
3. Commit updates.
4. Push changes back to my remote repository.
5. Make my work visible for my Instructors who will access my assignments.
